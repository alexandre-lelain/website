        use a service simply by opening the browser and reaching its url. The web connects, and impacts the whole world. With the upcoming PWA apps, our web applications are now also
        mobile-friendly, and promote the following motto - one application for <strong>any</strong> support.<br/><br/> This is why I am convinced tomorrow's stakes are in the Web. Furthermore, I really enjoy the challenges that
        come around it - create <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>robust</strong> FrontEnds, <strong>optimize</strong>, and <strong>automate</strong> delivery, tests and integration are what keeps me up at night!
